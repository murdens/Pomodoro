<strong>POMODORO CLOCK PROJECT</strong>

https://murdens.github.io/Pomodoro/

TheOdinProject

JAVASCRIPT, HTML AND CSS

- Utilised Wes Bos Countdown timer as basis for Javascript
- Pomodoro has default setting and option to set own session timer and rounds using prompt pop ups.
- Each round has an alarm notification (www.orangefreesounds.com)
- Clock resets when total required rounds reached

<strong>Further development when revisit project</strong>

- Use form or another alternate method to set own session
- Improved CSS styling
- Review and possible refactor of JS

<strong>Approach</strong>

I approached the functional requirements first.  In prep I completed the Wes Bos countdown tutorial which was great to understand the setInterval method.  The challenge I found was the reset of the interval and auto start of the next session.

Overall I'm happy with the final functional workings.  I have realised I need to build my CSS skillset and I probably could have made more use of the DOM.
